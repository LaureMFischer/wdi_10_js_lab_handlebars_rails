# Handlebars on Rails

At the `/reference` path in this app, you will find a static HTML reference page. Your goal is to make the `/profile` path display the *exact* same HTML, by making an Ajax JSON request to `/profile` and rendering a [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) template using the returned data. Use JsRoutes to get the correct path for the request.
